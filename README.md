# OBG-DAO

This repo contains the contracts and links for the Oregon Blockchain Group governance platform. This project is intended to create a wallet-based voting system for fund pitches, ops and finance related decisions, and anything else! The frontend/UI will use [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/) while the backend for distributing tokens/votes will be a custom contract deployed on mainnet. 

This was my first time creating and deploying contracts to a blockchain. I was able to do this by following the [Alchemy tutorial](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/how-to-create-an-nft). In the future, we can deploy the contracts directly from our local node instead of using scripts/rpc nodes.
