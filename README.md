# OBG-DAO

Contracts and links for the Oregon Blockchain Group governance platform. This project is intended to create a wallet-based voting system for fund pitches, ops and finance related decisions, and anything inbetween! The frontend/UI will use [snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/) while the backend for distributing tokens/votes will be a custom contract deployed on mainnet.
